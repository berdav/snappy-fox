Snappy-fox is a Snappy file decompressor (i.e. morgue cache of Firefox)
which does not have dependencies. It can also reconstruct corrupted
files.

## Why?
Online applications such as whatsapp web (web.whatsapp.com) save cache
files (e.g. images) in a compressed way.

You can recognize these files searching for the pattern sNaPpY:
```bash
grep 'sNaPpY' ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/storage/default/*/cache/morgue/*/*
```

This application can help the retrieval of such cache files.

## Setup
Just compile this application, you will need a C compiler
(gcc or clang) and make
```bash
sudo apt install make gcc
```

Then just compile the application
```bash
make
```

You can add debug prints with
```bash
make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG
```

## How?

The usage of the application is pretty simple:
```bash
./snappy-fox <input-file> <output-file>
```
The input or the output files can be `-` to use, respectively, stdin and
stdout.

For instance you can do:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/extracted-cache-whatsapp
for f in
  find ~/.mozilla/firefox/**/storage/default/https+++web.whatsapp.com/cache/ -name '*.final';
  do
    ./snappy-fox "$f" "/tmp/extracted-cache-whatsapp/$(basename $f)"
done
```

it will extract all your cache files in the
`/tmp/extracted-cache-whatsapp` directory.

## Example

You can try the application with the example image present in the
example directory:
```bash
./snappy-fox example/exampleimage.snappy example/exampleimage.jpg
```

`alteredimage.snappy` is a corrupted version of the image, you can see
the retrival performance of the tool using:
```bash
./snappy-fox --ignore_offset_errors example/alteredimage.snappy example/alteredimage.jpg
```
